I just purchased two posters from [JoeyRoth.com](http://joeyroth.com/posters/), "Charlatan, Martyr, Hustler", and "Grind/Dream".

Those posters reflect the ways I want to live by.

I found out Joey Roth from John Sonmez's video on Youtube,  "[What Are These Pictures On My Wall?](https://youtu.be/a4MemzkIxEA?t=14s)" You can watch John Sonmez's reason on why he's got "Charlatan, Martyr, Hustler" poster.

You can buy posters with quality frames from [JoeyRoth.com](http://joeyroth.com) but it was over my budget so I just purchased posters and ordered frames elsewhere.

Here are the posters framed and rested on a shelf.

**Charlatan, Martyr, Hustler** (First picture on the top left)

I am guilty of being a charlatan, all talk and no action/work. I will move toward becoming a martyr by becoming humble. Eventual goal is to learn to promote myself and become a hustler.

**Grind vs. Dream** (Second picture on the top middle)

When you grind away, you can reach your goal much easily in the end. Dreamers could probably reach their goal but it'd be much tougher

### Conclusion

I am now constantly reminded of the way I should live by.
