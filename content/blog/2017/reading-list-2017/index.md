[SmartCuts](https://www.amazon.com/Smartcuts-Breakthrough-Power-Lateral-Thinking/dp/0062560751/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1485056991&sr=8-1&keywords=smartcut) was the book that got me interested in reading back in 2015. I never read a single self-development book. Then I came to read [the Slight Edge](https://www.amazon.com/Slight-Edge-Turning-Disciplines-Happiness/dp/1626340463/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1485057083&sr=8-1&keywords=the+slight+edge) not long after and decided to make a reading a habit to replace my existing habit (reading manga) to **apply** what I learned from Charles Duhigg's [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1485057128&sr=8-1&keywords=the+power+of+habit).

After a year of reading only 10 pages a day every day for a year, reading became sort of a new habit.

![](https://www.slightedgecoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tracking-link-300x143.jpg)I read **90+ books** last year alone (Click "Tracking" menu, which takes you to Google Sheet. Then click on "Books I read in 2016" worksheet.)

I decided to post a blog to set my goal in stone by **making it public**.

Here are the **40 books** I will read this year.

Books are listed in no particular order. I usually read whatever I feel like reading at the moment.

**Fiction**

### Conclusion

I WILL read all 40 books by the end of 2017. It's much less than the number of books I read last year. The reason is because I randomly pick up books (either in English or in Korean) on a whim whenever I think a certain knowledge is required or just want to have fun reading. And also, I read many Korean books online on a site called Munpia where authors write a chapter or two every day.
