I started reading [The Richest Man in Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Richest_Man_in_Babylon_(book)) a few days ago.

One of my coworkers is a voracious reader so I was telling him how enticing the book was.

While having a conversation, I had an epiphany

I've been putting 100% at work and sometimes work extra hours over the weekend. I was always tired and had low motivation to develop my technical skills, which resulted in downward spiral of inefficiency. Then during a conversation with my coworker, something hit me hard.

The book is a parable with a richest man named "Arkad" in ancient Babylon about building wealth. Arkad teaches students that one should set aside 10% of what they earn and invest it to fatten their "wallets".

The **epiphany** was that, _**I could apply the same concept of building wealth in my work/life balance**_.

> Instead of giving 100% at work, I should set aside minimum of 10% of energy for my own development

After coming back from work, I used to always feel exhausted and had low motivation to learn anything new.

It's quite funny that I ran into this podcast [episode #35 - Working Hours](http://cynicaldeveloper.com/podcast/35/) by James Studdart, [the Cynical Developer](http://cynicaldeveloper.com/) (check out this awesome developer podcast) after the epiphany.

To rephrase James,

> Put extra hours if you slacked off but don't do so unless you have to

And also, [Jamie](https://www.gaprogman.com/) (@GaProgMan) has also given me advices on how to distribute one's effort on [Coding Blocks Slack channel](https://www.codingblocks.net/slack/).

Here is the conversation on **#books** channel (posted with a permission from Jamie)

### What I learned Today

I should set aside self-development time of my own.

Doing so would not only help me relax and also improve my work/life balance
