Recently read [The Sketchnote Handbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15858089-the-sketchnote-handbook) by [Mike Rohde](http://rohdesign.com).

One of the benefits is to retain knowledge longer by helping you convert abstract knowledge into visual representations.

Here are my first sketchnotes created while watching [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux).

## Sketchnotes

Here are the sketchnotes summarizing (most of videos).

## 👍 Benefits

As mentioned above, I was able to understand "why"s behind each method in Redux.

## 👎 Downside

So far, my drawing skill is quite lacking thus it took over 5+ hours to finish for the 2 hour course.

## 🧐 What I Learned

Coming up with visual way helped me to extract only the most important part.

I need more practice on writing & drawing, which requires a continuous effort.

## 👋 Parting Words

I'd not recommend if you are an auditory learner (but great for visual or kinetic learners).

_but it wouldn't hurt._
