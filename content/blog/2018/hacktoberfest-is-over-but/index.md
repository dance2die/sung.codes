_**Self note...**_

Hacktoberfest is over but it has helped me to quickly do a PR for simple typo fixes.

The more I do a PR the easier it seems to contribute.

Did a [quick PR](https://github.com/h2non/node-imaginary/pull/18) to fix a typo (merged at this point) in an open source project documentation for [node-imaginary](https://github.com/h2non/node-imaginary).

I now see what [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) (DO) was trying to achieve with Hacktoberfest.

Not only were DO trying to giving back to the developer community, DO was trying to help us developers to get used to the **process** and contribute more, which helps others as well.

취지가 정말로 좋은것 같습니다. (_better expressed in Korean_).
